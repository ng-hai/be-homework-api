# Coding Challenge

### Design

The design of these screens are provided on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pzXlcxlwtGldootIuyw98X/Coding-challenge):

- The design includes a simple prototype to help you understand the connections between these screens. To try it, click on the “Play/Present” on the top right corner.

- You don’t need to implement the status bar at top and the navigation bar at bottom. They only exist to provide the design context.
- You can implement the interactive states (such as “hover” and “active”) in any way you want (such as a darker background or lower opacity).

### Server API

The API for these screens are listed on [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14269858/TVzYga54):

- Although the returned responses are static, we do expect you to always fetch from the demo server instead of hard-coding the information into your code.

### Deliver

You are free to use any frameworks or libraries you want to get the job done. In fact, your choices of tools and technologies here will be the main focus of our follow-up chat after this challenge.

After finishing your app, please deploy it online. We recommend a simple service like Vercel or Netlify, but as other aspects, you are free to choose.

### Communication

Please do not hesitate to ask us questions about anything you don’t feel clear or right, at any time. This also includes any concerns you may have regarding the design, API or the challenge itself.

Good luck!
